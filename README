A jmeter .jmx file for drupal 7 based on the Drupal Performance Suite by Jacob Singh
( http://github.com/jacobSingh/Drupal-Performance-Testing-Suite )

Usage:
======

Before executing the test plan you should set some variables:

in General:
	- outputDir 
	- delay ( set to TRUE if you want to introduce delay )

in Drupal-7:
	- path


To get "Authenticated Browsing" and "Comment" working,
You should add at least 1 user and 1 corresponding password  to "Possible Users"
Adding multiple users is possible

example:

Name: 		Value:
user_1		drupal1
pass_1		drupal1pw
user_2		drupal2
pass_2		drupal2pw
number_usr	2		-> you should not forget to increment the number of users


Jmeter will randomly select 1 of the inputed users


Some notes:
==========

By default the results of visiting a node are grouped by nid.
It's possible to change this by changing the name of the module
( e.g. "node" instead of "node-${__evalVar(${idx})}" )
