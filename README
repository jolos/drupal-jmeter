A jmeter .jmx file for drupal 7 based on the Drupal Performance Suite by Jacob Singh
( http://github.com/jacobSingh/Drupal-Performance-Testing-Suite )

Dependencies:
=============
  ant
  ant-contrib
  jmeter

Usage:
======

For executing the following are required:
  - a directory "properties" containing property files 
  - the drupal7.jmx file
  - .csv files containing either users and passwords either the pages to visit

The drupal7.jmx is as generic as possible, the properties are defined
in a ".properties" file located in the properties folder

If you want to add a new configuration, just add a new .properties file in the properties folder

configuration of a .properties file
---------------------------------
Before creating this file, it can be useful to take a look at the .jmx file

example:

meta.name=prop2/ 	#write the output of this test to this directory ( trailing slash is required )
output.prefix=		#if you want to add a prefix to the output, ( can be handy, when you want to output everything to 1 directory )
delay=FALSE  		#if TRUE, introduce delay to simulate user interaction

#properties for anonymous browsing
anon.url_file=anon.csv 	#specify the the URL's that will be visited
anon.threads=0		#the number of threads, disabled if 0
anon.lcount=1		#number of times, the thread will run
anon.ramp=60		#The ramp up period
 
#and similar for authenticated browsing
auth.url_file=auth.csv 
auth.usr_file=auth-usr.csv
auth.threads=2
auth.lcount=5
auth.ramp=30

starting the tests
------------------

cd into the directory containing 'build.xml'
and just type:

ant

You can delete the output as follows:

ant clean

You can generate html for a result log as follows:

ant make_html -Dxmlfile=./output/prop1/overall-summary.xml -Dhtmlfile=./overall-summary.html
